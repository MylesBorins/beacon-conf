##About

This starts off where I left off with libmdns.
Most likely that stuff will all be gone, as will this text.
Moving in a new direction with osc... specifically using liblo

I'm thinking about maybe finding some sort of crazy drone in faust.

Graphics will be done in openGL starting with Ge Wang's mcd-api

ok go!
